        <p>There's an increasing volume of computerised prescriptions each month where the prescriber has prescribed a generic Drug Tariff Part VIIIA product but also with the name of the branded product or the supplier/ manufacturer added in brackets.</p>

        <p>In these situations, the drug costs charged to the prescriber's budget and reimbursed to the community pharmacy or dispensing practice will be that of the list price of the branded medicine or the specified supplier.</p>

        <p>In many cases this cost will be significantly higher than the Drug Tariff Part VIIIA listed price.</p>

        <p>To help SICBLs monitor this scenario more closely and explore opportunities for review, we've developed this dashboard to highlight the details of practices and drugs where this is most common.</p>

        <p>Data includes current spend, potential spend and potential saving, these appear to be provided to us at SICBL
            level but calculated elsewhere in the dashboard. Potential saving is calculated, detail included in the
            dictionary.

        <p>A data dictionary is a document that describes the fields in a dataset, providing explanations of what each field represents, the type of data it contains, and any additional relevant information.</p>

        <p>Limited to organisations held as GP practices in our organisational database.</p>
        <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Organisational level</h4>
        <p>Data is available at both practice level and Sub-Integrated Care Board Location (SICBL) level.</p>
        <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">How often is the data updated</h4>
        <p>Updated monthly, in line with the ePACT2 refresh (usually around the 20th of each month). Includes prescribing of generic-name AMPs (generics with a supplier name) only where a saving is possible.</p>
        <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Data lineage/provenance</h4>
        <p>ePACT2 is the source of most of the data.</p>

        <p>No patient information is included in the dashboard. Data is aggregated to practice level. Risk of
            reidentification of patients is low. Purpose is a cost analysis for NHS organisations. To be used by
            appropriate NHS professionals.</p>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Caveats and limitations</h3>
            <p>Data is limited to GP practices and where we have calculated that there is a potential saving based on
                the costs of the products prescribed. Comparison of cost appears to be the current price vs the price in
                the month specified. The data may not be representative of recent changes in price. No suppression has been applied, access
                to the dashboard is limited to registered users.</p>
